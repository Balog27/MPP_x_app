# Static Code 2FA Implementation

## Overview
We've successfully implemented a simpler alternative to time-based 2FA by adding a static code option. This will make testing the 2FA functionality easier since the code doesn't change every 30 seconds.

## Key Features Added

### Backend Changes:
1. **Enhanced TwoFactorService**
   - Added `generateStaticCode()` method to create a 6-digit static code
   - Added `verifyStaticCode()` method to verify static codes
   - Updated `verifyToken()` to detect and route to the appropriate verification method

2. **New API Endpoints**
   - `/api/2fa/setup-static` - Generates a static code for the user
   - `/api/2fa/verify-setup-static` - Verifies and enables static code 2FA

3. **Enhanced Response Data**
   - Login responses now include `twoFactorType` to indicate whether a user has TOTP or static 2FA
   - 2FA verification responses include `isStaticCode` flag

### Frontend Changes:
1. **New Components**
   - Created `StaticTwoFactorSetup.jsx` component for static code setup
   - Added corresponding styling in `StaticTwoFactorSetup.css`

2. **Enhanced Existing Components**
   - Updated `TwoFactorVerify.jsx` to detect and handle static codes differently
   - Updated `TwoFactorManagement.js` to offer both authentication options
   - Added styling to distinguish between regular and testing methods

3. **State Management**
   - Updated `AuthContext.js` to track and maintain 2FA type information
   - Added localStorage/sessionStorage for persistence of 2FA type preferences

## Documentation
- Created `2FA_GUIDE.md` with detailed instructions for users and developers

## How to Test
1. Register a new user
2. Navigate to the Two-Factor Authentication management section
3. Choose "Set Up with Static Code"
4. Note the 6-digit code provided
5. Verify setup by entering the same code
6. Log out and log back in
7. When prompted for 2FA, enter the same static code again

The interface will adapt based on the type of 2FA being used, showing appropriate guidance for static codes vs. TOTP authenticator app codes.

## Notes for Future Improvement
- Add recovery codes for both 2FA methods
- Improve detection of 2FA type when switching between methods
- Add more comprehensive tests for the 2FA flow
